<h1><b>FOODS UNIQUE TO KYOTO</b></h1>
<h3>3. Kyoto Nishin Soba</h3>
<p>Nishin soba consists of sweetly boiled herring atop warm soba noodles. 
    This particular dish became popular in Kyoto because herring preserves very well, and in previous ages,
     Kyoto was too far inland for fresh fish to be delivered there safely. 
     That said, Nishin soba has been eaten in Kyoto for over 150 years and is one of the city's signature dishes. When eating this dish, most are surprised at the sheer size of the herring.
     The meat is soft, and its sweet flavor blends in with the broth, creating one exquisite dish.</p>

    <h3>Kyoto Mackerel sushi</h3>
    <p>Much like Nishin soba, salted mackerel was a valuable preserved food in Kyoto. From it came the soon-to-be-popular mackerel sushi. With no cooling technology or transportation infrastructure, the mackerel of the past was rolled in from Fukui on carriages. The road it took it still called Saba Kaido, Mackerel Road. Chefs would pickle the mackerel in vinegar and put it together with vinegar-seasoned rice to make mackerel sushi.
        <br>The thick mackerel meat mixes well with the acidic taste of the vinegar rice, giving it a unique taste.
         Putting some kombu on top of it gives it an even deeper flavor.</p>

         <h3>Kyoto Matcha </h3>
         <p>If there's one type of sweet that feels Japanese, it's those that use matcha. 
             While there are plenty in existence, of particular note is the increasingly popular matcha parfait. 
             Kyoto's Uji City is well known for its tea production, which provides Kyoto with plenty of high quality matcha. The parfaits come with a variety of toppings with its ice cream, too, such as jelly, cream, castella, bavarois, and more. 
             They're definitely worth a try, and a sweet you can't miss if you're visiting Kyoto</p>
