        <p><h2>Where you want to live</h2>
        <h4>Districts in northern Kyoto, including Iwakura, Kitayama, Shimogamo and the Demachiyanagi, 
            are very popular, in part because their distance from the city centre makes them less expensive. 
            These areas are all close to public transport, have a good sprinkling of bars and restaurants, 
            and are located closer to the mountains. 

            Many of the apartment buildings in Kyoto are old, so newer stock can go for a premium. 
            On average, a 20sqm one-bedroom apartment rents for around 50,000 to 60,000 yen a month, 
            while apartments with more square footage go for around 110,000 yen a month. 
            Some people who have lived in the city for a while move out to the Shiga prefecture, east of Kyoto,
             which is an easy commute into the city via train but has much lower taxes.</h4>
        <p>
            <p><h2>Side Trips</h2>There are many day walks around Kyoto, up hills and mountains such as Arashiyama, Ohara
                , Daimonji and Mount Hiei. In the summer, residents head to Omi Maiko beach on Lake Biwa to the east,
                 the largest freshwater lake in Japan. Nagano, where the 1998 Winter Olympics were held, is northeast of Kyoto and is a big draw in winter for snowboarding and skiing. Both are easy rail trips on the Shinkansen, the bullet trains that speed through the Japanese countryside.

               <h4> The trains also link Kyoto to Tokyo (two and a half hours away) as well as Kobe and Osaka, 
                both of which are about an hour away and have a more happening nightlife scene than Kyoto. 
                There is no airport in Kyoto, but Kansai International Airport is slightly more than an hour away in Osaka.
