<h1><b>KYOTO ATTRACTIONS</b></h1>
<h3>Kinkaku-Ji</h3>
<p>The fact that Kyoto is home to many temples and shrines is nothing new! 
    Kinkaku-Ji is certainly the most widely-recognized among all of them. 
    The breathtaking sight of the golden temple floating over a mirror pond, 
    surrounded by small islands and pines has coined its name as the “The Golden Pavilion.”</p>

    <h3>Ryoanji Temple</h3>
    <p>Compared to its peer- Kinkaku Temple, Ryoanji is no less attractive to the eyes of all the visitors! The temple was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as a part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto. It is labeled as the most beautiful rock garden in Kyoto, with the rocks positioned in small groups which at least one of them cannot be seen from any vantage point.

 

        The thing that intrigues visitors to come to Ryoanji Temple is the mystery of it. Till now there’s no exact information on the meaning behind the construction of this building. Some say the mystery is left unveiled, as to invite curious viewers to come and find out themselves.
        
         <br>Ryoanji is surprisingly spacious with a park area that includes a stunning pond. No wonder why it is one of the most visited sites in Kyoto.
        
         <br>Like Kinkaku-Ji, Ryoanji Temple is extremely crowded, and if you don’t want to have tourists in every photo you take, try visiting the place earlier in the day.
        
        </p>
        <h3>Kifune Shrine</h3>
        <p>Kifune Shrine is the oldest shrine in Kyoto and has long been a site of worship for the deity of water and 
            rain. Rumor has it that the shrine brings good luck to those who will be heading to sea.
             You only need to take one of the water fortune-telling paper and place them into the sacred pools in the shrine. And for those who have long been struggling to find their other half, Kifune Shrine has got your back! Kifune Shrine is also known for its power of matchmaking, where you can buy a Musibi Fumi-knotted letter for roughly 200 yen, then tie it on a tree after you write your wishes.
            <br> The shrine itself is so beautiful, lined with vermillion lanterns on both sides of the entrance.
             Kifune Shrine is stunningly charming throughout all four seasons. It’s hard to pick just one, but my recommendation is to visit the shrine during the summer during the Tabata festival and when lanterns are lit everywhere. </p>
