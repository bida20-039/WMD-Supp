        <h1><b>KYOTO FESTIVALS AND EVENTS</b></h1>
        <P>The Kyoto year is packed with interesting festivals and events. Here is a summary of Kyoto’s biggest and most interesting annual festivals and events.</P>
        <h2>January</h2>
        <h3>1, 2, 3 January: Hatsumode (First Shrine Visit of the New Year)</h3>
        <p>On New Year’s Eve, and on the first three days of the New Year (1, 2 and 3 January), 
            Kyotoites visit either their local neighborhood shrine or one of Kyoto’s major shrines to pay for luck, 
            success and health in the New Year. Visitors to Kyoto are more than welcome to join. 
            Just be ready for crowds!</p>
            <h3>8~12 January: Toka Ebisu</h3>
            <p>This is one of our favorite Kyoto festivals. It’s held at Ebisu-jinja Shrine, which is a short walk from either Gion-Shijo or Kiyomizu-Gojo Stations on the Keihan Line.
                 It happens all day from the 8th to the 12th, but it’s best to go in the evenings, 
                 when the place gets packed and raucous. Ebisu-san is one of the Shichifukujin, the Seven Lucky Gods of Japanese mythology. 
                 Ebisu-san is the god of prosperity and so anyone looking to get rich shows up to ask for Ebisu-san’s blessings in the New Year. The main part of the ritual is throwing some cash into the donation box in front of the main hall,
                  then ringing the bell and saying a prayer to Ebisu-san. 
                 After praying to Ebisu, people make their way around to the right side of the main hall and bang their fists on a board there and repeat their prayers. Ebisu-san is said to be hard of hearing – hence the need to make a racket.</p>
        <h2>February</h2>
        <h3>2 and 3 February: Setsubun</h3>
        <p>Setsubun marks the beginning of spring according to the old lunar calendar in Japan. Because it marks a new beginning, it’s the time to caste off old bad things and invite in good new things.
             At homes, people throw roasted soybeans out the door of their houses while shouting “Oni wa soto! Fuku wa uchi!” 
            (Devils out! Good luck in!). People also commonly eat one roasted soybean for each year of their life, plus another for good luck in the coming year. 
            Various temples and shrines around Kyoto hold Setsubun events, including Yasaka-jinja Shrine, Hiean-jingu Shrine, Yoshida-jinja Shrine, and Tenryu-ji Temple.</p>
        <h2>March</h2>
        <h3>3~12 March: Higashiyama Hanatoro</h3>
        <p>Higashiyama’s Hanatoro is one of the cooler events of the Kyoto year. 
            It’s held in the Southern Higashiyama sightseeing district. Lanterns are placed along the lanes and roads of the area, all converging on Maruyama-koen Park, where various light sculptures and installations are on display 
            (provided by Kyoto art school students). The effect is utterly magical.
             There is no better time for a stroll in this area. Don’t miss it if you’re in town.</p>
        <h3>Mid-March to the End of March: Southern Higashiyama Temple Illuminations</h3>
        <p>For most of March, one or more of the major temples in the Southern Higashiyama District hold special evening temple illuminations, in which the buildings and gardens are illuminated.
             The effect is magical. Temples holding illuminations include Shoren-in, Kodai-ji, and Kiyomizu-dera.</p>
        <h3>25 March~31 March (until 7 April): Kitano Odori Geisha Dance</h3>
        <p>Each of Kyoto’s five geisha districts holds a major series of dance performances once a year.
             Four of these happen in the spring. This one, held by the geisha houses of the northern Kamishichiken Geisha District, is very special. The scale is rather intimate and the dance is always superb.
             It doesn’t necessarily feel like stepping back in time, it feels more like stepping out of time.</p>
